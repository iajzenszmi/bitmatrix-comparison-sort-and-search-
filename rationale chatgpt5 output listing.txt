Here’s a concrete, technically distinct idea you can take forward. I’ll give you: the algorithm, why it’s value-add vs. known methods, complexity, pseudocode, implementation notes (CPU/GPU), and a patent-style claims skeleton you can start from. (I’m not giving legal advice—this is a technical foundation you can take to a patent attorney.)

Bitmatrix Comparison Sort & Search (BCSS)

Core idea (what’s new)

Instead of repeatedly moving elements during partitioning (as in quicksort/sample-sort) or performing many passes over keys (as in radix), BCSS performs one vectorized comparison pass of all items against a small, adaptively chosen set of ordered pivots and records the results in a compact bitmatrix. From that bitmatrix we compute bucket ranks with prefix sums and do one stable scatter. The same bitmatrix also powers fast search by mapping any query to its bucket via a single pivot-comparison word and then doing a short, contiguous binary search.

Key technical levers that differentiate BCSS:

1. Comparison bitmatrix: For k ordered pivots , each element  yields a k-bit signature  where bit  is 1 iff . This encodes the element’s bucket (between two consecutive pivots) without moving it. Storing all  as a bit-packed matrix enables SIMD/bit-parallel prefix sums and rank/select operations.


2. Rank-from-bits placement: Using the per-bucket bit columns, we compute exact write offsets without further comparisons, then do one stable scatter of all items into  buckets (cache-friendly).


3. Adaptive pivot maintenance: Pivots are initially sampled (e.g., KLL-style or stratified random sample). After each sort (or incrementally from streams), pivots are adjusted with lightweight statistics (per-bucket medians or exponential moving quantiles) so the structure converges to your data distribution. That’s what makes repeat sorts and many searches faster than fresh sorts each time.


4. Unified search path: A query  is compared to pivots to form a k-bit word . That gives its bucket index in O(k/w) bit ops; then do a local binary search inside that contiguous bucket (post-sort) or a gallop search in partially ordered runs (pre-sort, optional).

Algorithm overview

Build phase (one pass, no moves)

1. Choose  ordered pivots . (Sampling step.)


2. For each element :

Vector-compare  with the pivot block to produce k bits .

Store  in a packed bitmatrix  (shape: , packed by columns for cache).



3. From , derive bucket membership for each i:  (number of pivots it’s ).


4. Compute bucket sizes via parallel popcounts, then exclusive prefix sums to get bucket base offsets.



Scatter (one pass, stable)

5. Maintain a running write pointer per bucket (initialized from base offsets).


6. Single pass over the input: write  to its bucket’s next offset. Stability follows from left-to-right visitation.



Finalization

7. Intra-bucket sort: Each bucket is small. Sort them in parallel with insertion sort (tiny) or introsort (larger). If k is chosen so average bucket size is , this phase is tiny.



Search

To search for value :

1. Compare  to pivots once → bit-word .


2.  selects bucket .


3. Binary search within contiguous bucket .

Why this is value-add vs. prior art

Versus multi-pivot quicksort / sample sort: They route elements by moving through multiple partitioning stages. BCSS performs all comparisons up front, stores them compactly, and moves each element exactly once (final scatter). Less write-amplification and better cache behavior.

Versus radix / counting sort: Those require digit extraction or bounded key ranges. BCSS works with arbitrary comparators and types (including complex objects) because it’s comparison-based.

Versus learned indexes / histogram sort / range Bloom filters: BCSS’s bitmatrix of comparison outcomes and the specific rank-from-bits stable scatter are new in combination; the data structure doubles as a search accelerator without training, model fitting, or probabilistic false positives.

Streaming & incremental: You can append elements: compute their bit-word, place into per-bucket buffers, and flush/merge with low contention. Pivots adapt over time to the real distribution.



---

Complexity

Build comparisons:  comparisons, but done in SIMD batches (k fits in a few cache lines).

Popcounts & prefix sums:  word ops (w = machine word bits).

Scatter:  moves (one write per item).

Intra-bucket sort: . With near-equal buckets (target ), total intra-bucket work is .

Choosing  typically yields near-linear behavior in practice due to tiny buckets and excellent cache locality.


Search after sorting: one pivot-block compare + a short binary search in bucket → typically .

Pseudocode (sketch)

function bcss_sort(A, comparator, k):
    pivots = choose_pivots(A, k, comparator)       // sorted
    B = bitmatrix(n=len(A), k=k)                   // packed columns

    // Build bitmatrix
    for i in 0..n-1:
        word = 0
        // Vectorizable: compare A[i] to pivot block
        for j in 0..k-1:
            if comparator(A[i], pivots[j]) <= 0:   // A[i] ≤ p_j ?
                word |= (1 << j)
        B.store_row_bits(i, word)

    // Bucket sizes
    counts[0..k] = 0
    for i in 0..n-1:
        j = popcount(B.row_bits(i))                // bucket index
        counts[j]++

    // Prefix sums -> base offsets
    base[0] = 0
    for j in 1..k:
        base[j] = base[j-1] + counts[j-1]
    write_ptr = base.clone()

    // Stable scatter
    Out = array(n)
    for i in 0..n-1:
        j = popcount(B.row_bits(i))
        pos = write_ptr[j]; write_ptr[j]++
        Out[pos] = A[i]

    // Sort buckets locally
    for j in parallel 0..k:
        l = base[j]
        r = (j==k ? n : base[j+1]) - 1
        local_sort(Out[l..r], comparator)

    return Out, pivots, base

Search after sort:

function bcss_search(Out, pivots, base, q, comparator):
    word = 0
    for j in 0..k-1:
        if comparator(q, pivots[j]) <= 0:
            word |= (1 << j)
    b = popcount(word)                       // bucket index
    l = base[b]; r = (b==k ? len(Out) : base[b+1]) - 1
    return binary_search(Out[l..r], q, comparator)

Implementation notes & optimizations

SIMD: Compare a vector of items to broadcasted pivot blocks and compute bitmasks with _mm_cmple_*/_mm_movemask_*. For integers/floats, use AVX2/AVX-512; for strings, compare first fixed-length prefixes to pre-partition heavy hitters.

Bit-packing layout: Store the bitmatrix column-major (per-pivot bitset across items), so bucket counts are just popcounts of those columns (and chainable with fused-popcount instructions).

Cache locality: The algorithm writes each element once (sequentially) → very low write-amplification; reads are streaming.

Choosing k: Start with . If keys are skewed, adapt k (e.g., split heavy buckets on the next run).

Stability: Guaranteed by single left-to-right scatter.

Parallelism: Build, popcount, and intra-bucket sorts are all embarrassingly parallel; per-bucket write pointers can be managed with local thread-private counters + a global base.

GPU variant: Each thread compares its element to pivots (in shared memory), writes its bucket id, then a parallel exclusive scan over bucket flags yields scatter addresses. Finish with per-bucket block sorts.

External / streaming: Maintain per-bucket runs on disk; because each element goes to exactly one run, you get low I/O amplification similar to distribution sort but with fewer passes.

Where it shines

Repeated search + periodic resort: Analytics pipelines, log deduplication, column stores: you can reuse/adapt pivots and keep buckets warm.

Wide keys with custom comparators: You get the benefits of “distribution sorting” without needing hashing or radix digits.

Skewed data: Adaptive pivots squeeze large modes into targeted buckets, reducing total comparisons and boosting search hit locality.



---

Empirical plan (to demonstrate advantage)

1. Benchmarks vs. std::sort, IPS⁴o/sample-sort, Timsort, multi-pivot quicksort on:

Random, nearly-sorted, reverse, zipfian, and multi-modal distributions.

Mixed types: 64-bit ints, doubles, short strings (8–32 bytes), and composite structs.



2. Metrics: total comparisons, bytes written, L3 misses, wall-clock time, throughput (M items/s).


3. Show re-run speedup when reusing/adapting pivots on stationary distributions.


4. Search latency distribution after sort vs. classic binary search over whole array.




---

Variants

BCSS-Lite: Skip intra-bucket sort; you still get fast approximate search (gallop in each bucket), useful for online filters.

Hierarchical BCSS: Recursively apply BCSS within large buckets to target nearly linear time.

Stable selection: k-select by marking target bucket(s) from bitmatrix without full sort.



---

Limitations & mitigations

If comparisons are extremely expensive, the initial  compare pass can dominate. Mitigate by smaller k + hierarchical pass only for large buckets.

Highly adversarial distributions against the pivot set → use adaptive splitting (detect heavy buckets and refine on the fly).

Draft claim skeleton (technical)

Independent claim (method):

1. A computer-implemented method for ordering elements and accelerating queries comprising:

selecting an ordered set of k pivots for a collection of n elements;

for each element, computing a k-bit comparison signature indicating, for each pivot, whether the element is ordered before or equal to that pivot;

determining a bucket index for each element from a population count of its signature;

computing bucket write offsets via prefix sums over bucket counts;

performing a single stable scatter of elements into contiguous buckets using the offsets; and

sorting elements within each bucket; wherein the k-bit signatures are stored in a bit-packed matrix and reused to map query keys to buckets by generating a query signature and population count thereof.




Dependent claims (examples):

The method of claim 1, wherein comparisons and population counts are executed using SIMD vector instructions.

The method of claim 1, further comprising adapting pivot values using per-bucket statistics across runs.

The method of claim 1, wherein the scatter is performed in parallel with thread-local counters and global base offsets.

The method of claim 1, applied on a GPU with a parallel exclusive scan to obtain write offsets.

The method of claim 1, wherein the algorithm guarantees stability by preserving left-to-right order within buckets.


System and storage-medium claims mirroring the method.
